# TPRM-Program-Design
## Objective
Designed and simulated a full-scale TPRM program aligned to NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and OSFI B-10. This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of third-party risk governance â€” from intake, inherent risk classification, and security assessments, to residual risk scoring, remediation, and risk treatment decisioning.

### Key Deliverables
- Developed a TPRM Policy Document covering purpose, scope, risk governance, and control expectations
- Created a vendor intake form and inherent risk tiering matrix to triage vendors by data sensitivity, access, and integration
- Built a quantitative scoring model for inherent risk with simulation across multiple vendors
- Created a NIST- and ISO-mapped vendor risk questionnaire and scored responses to determine residual risk
- Designed and applied a residual risk tiering model, including thresholds and treatment decision logic
- Simulated a vendor remediation scenario, documented remediation plan, and updated treatment record
- Created supporting artifacts including a risk register, visual workflows, scoring templates, and policy guidance
